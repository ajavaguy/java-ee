- What is Java EE?
    - Set of API specifications.
    - Support development of enterprise: data persistence, building REST API, Dependency Injection, Security... 
- Java EE APIs:
    -  JSF, JSTL, JSP, JAX-RS 2.1, Servlet 4.0, WebSocket 1.0, CDI 2.0, EL 3.0, Bean Validation 2.0, JSON-B 1.0, JSON-P 1.1, JPA 2.2, EJB 3.2, JMS 2.0, Security 1.0
-  Servlet API
    - Servlet run in a Servlet Container, which is a web or an application server for receiving responses and sending requests (HTTP requests sent by browser).
    - Provides request-handing HTTP methods like GET, POST
    - Asynchronous processing of requests.
    - HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, HttpSession, Cookie, ServletContext (communicate with Servlet Container), Filter.
- HTTP Message:
    - Headers
    - Cookies
    - Body
- Filter:
    - Sits in front of Servlet to allow transformations to be applied to request and responses process by Java EE application.
- Asynchronous:
    - asyncSupported = true for @WebServlet.
    - All filters are need to set asyncSupported = true as well.
    - AsyncContext asyncContext = request.startAsync();
    - Task which is processed by async is processed by another thread.
- JSP:
    - JSTL
    - EL (Expression Language)
- JSF:
- EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans): are APIs within Java EE that provide a standard component architecture for building object-oriented business applications.
    - An EJB is Java class or POJO.
    - Isolates system business logic.
    - Managed by an EJB container.
    - Injected into other Java EE components through a JNDI so they can be centralized and reused.
    - EJB Benefits:
        - Transaction
        - Security
        - Concurrency
        - Persistence
    - EJB types:
        - Session Bean:
            - Contains business logic that models an action or use case
            - Stateful: Unique for every client 
            - Stateless: Shared for every client and does not containts any state
            - Singleton: Shared for every client at an application level.
        - Message Driven Bean:
           - Bean that processes messages send by other components
           - Are stateless components that run on the server side for processing messages delivered by Java Messaging Service.
 - CDI (Context and Dependency Injection): Bean and Dependency Injection
     - Bean: Instantiated, managed, and injected by a container. Injected into servlet, other beans, JAX-RS resources
     - CDI:
         - Provides a standard Dependency Injection framework, improves structure of application code, manages beans.
         - There are 3 ways to inject a bean into another
            - @Inject
            - @Named if there are many types of a Bean
            - @Qualifier
            - @Producer
     - Discovery Mode:
         - Explicit: Contains a beans.xml file with bean-discovery-mode=all -> no longer need to annotate any of our classes in order to make them beans, they'll automatically be created as a bean in the CDI container.
         - Implicit: No beans.xml file. Contains one or more classes with a bean-defining annotation.
     - Bean Scope:
         - @Dependent: default
         - @RequestScoped: A single http request
         - @SessionScoped: Spans multiple http requests.
         - @ApplicationScoped: Shared across the entire application.
         - @ConversationScoped:
     - @Qualifier: Used to solve ambiguity among beans of the same types, indicates a particular bean instance should be injected.
     - @Producer:
         - If a bean needs to be determined dynamically at runtime or when an object requires special instances logic.
         - Achieve it by using @Produces and @Alternative
     - Intercepter method:
         - Allows developer to implement cross-cutting concern such as logging, auditing, security. To create a intercepter method.
         - Achieve this by creating a annotation with @IntercepterBinding, then creating a class with the annotation just created and @Intercepter.
- JPA (Java Persistence API): is Java EE API for accessing, persisting, and managing java object and a relational database.
    - JPA is just a specification or API, the underlying implementation is built by JPA providers. The most popular implematation of JPA is hibernate.
    - EntityManager:
       - Manages entities within a persistence context, provices API for creating , updating, deleting, and querying entities from a relational DB.
       - Management by container or application.
    - JPA applications are packaged with persistence.xml file that provides configuration properties for the JPA provider and a defination of persistence units.
    - Persistence unit is a logical grouping that contains metadata about the EntityManager. It contains all the information that can instruct an EntityManager on hw to persist the entities into a relational database.
    - Persistence Context contains the entity instances and manages thheir life cycle.
    - Entities in Persistence Context can the n be persisted to the ralational data store by an EntityManager.
    - JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)
       - Queries entities as apposed to the database schema.
    - Criteria Builder API
- Bean Validation:
    - Built-in constraints: @Size (min, max), @Blank, @Pattern, @Future @Past for Date, @Email for email, @AssertTrue for boolean, @Nagative, @Positive
    - Custom validation annotation: creating an annotation with @Pattern.List()
    - Custom constrain validator: adding a ConstraintValidator class that implements from an annotation class with @Constraint
